# MySQL DML Exercises 14/20 - The GROUP BY clause

# Write a query to select the top 10 paying customers with a first name that begins with S, ordered by total revenue in descending order.
# In other words:
# - Select all payments
# - Use LEFT JOIN to pull in information about the customer.
# - Use the CONCAT function to join first/last name together
# - Use GROUP BY and SUM to group payments by customer name combined with the sum of payment amounts to form total_revenue.
# - Use WHERE and the LEFT function to find customers with first name starting with S
# Include the following columns: Customer Name (First + Space + Last) as customer_name, Total Revenue as total_revenue
